### Final Report.Rmd and Final Report.pdf
This project aims to investigate the factors that lead to a higher HDB (public housing) resale price, and find a satisfactory model to predict the resale prices. Exploratory data analysis was used to briefly explore the relationships between variables and resale prices. Two supervised machine learning models, Linear Regression and Random Forest Tree, were used to model the relationships. 

### Linear_Regression_Inflation.qmd
Another assignment from my data analysis class that uses linear regression to model inflation rates.
